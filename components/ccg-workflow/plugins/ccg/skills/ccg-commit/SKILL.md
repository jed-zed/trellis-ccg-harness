# CCG Commit

Help prepare a commit without surprising the user.

## Behavior

- Run `git status --short`.
- Distinguish staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
- Recommend `/ccg:verify-change`, `/ccg:verify-quality <changed-path>`, and `/ccg:verify-security <changed-path>` when the diff is broad or security-sensitive.
- Use `scripts/commit_helper.js --check-gates --json` to collect full-worktree gate status before recommending a direct commit.
- Use `--scope staged|all` for gate collection. `--check-gates` defaults to `all`; `--execute` / `--confirm` defaults to `staged` and reports unstaged/untracked files as scope warnings.
- Generate a concise conventional commit message.
- Default to showing the command:

```text
git commit -m "<message>"
```

- Execute the commit only when the user explicitly says to commit directly.
- Refuse `--execute` / `--confirm` when no staged files exist.
- Refuse `--execute` / `--confirm` when gates fail; `--allow-gate-warnings` can continue only when gates produced warnings but no failures.

## Helper

Use `scripts/commit_helper.js` for mechanical status/message analysis. Report in Chinese.
