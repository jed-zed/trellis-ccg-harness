description: CCG command index for Codex. Use when the user invokes /ccg, asks what CCG commands are available, or gives a CCG plan/task without choosing a subcommand.

# CCG

This is the Codex plugin prompt index for CCG. Current Codex CLI builds may not show it in TUI slash autocomplete, but the invocation text still routes to this skill.

Route all real work to `skills/ccg-executor/SKILL.md`.

If the user provided no argument, answer in Chinese with the CCG command index:

- `/ccg:ccg` - show this index; with a plan path or task, execute it.
- `/ccg:plan <task>` - create or revise a CCG plan with Codex plus Gemini/Claude analysis evidence.
- `/ccg:workflow` - explain the Codex-native CCG workflow.
- `/ccg:doctor` - diagnose local CCG plugin, skill, MCP, bridge, and Gemini availability.
- `/ccg:doctor --fix` - from this source checkout only, refresh stale local plugin cache.
- `/ccg:execute <plan>` - execute a CCG plan with Codex as orchestrator and Gemini/Claude evidence when required.
- `/ccg:codex-exec <plan>` - explicit Codex-led execution alias with the same parity rules.
- `/ccg:excute <plan>` - typo-compatible alias.
- `/ccg:feat <task>` - implement a feature with Codex and bounded Gemini help.
- `/ccg:frontend <task>` - handle frontend/UI work with Gemini as a strong read-only UI helper.
- `/ccg:backend <task>` - handle backend-heavy work with Codex as the primary executor.
- `/ccg:analyze <target>` - read-only code, architecture, risk, or option analysis.
- `/ccg:debug <bug>` - reproduce, diagnose, fix, and verify failures.
- `/ccg:optimize <target>` - optimize with evidence, tests, and regression checks.
- `/ccg:test <target>` - add, repair, or design tests.
- `/ccg:enhance <task>` - enhance existing behavior while preserving local patterns.
- `/ccg:init` - initialize Codex-native CCG project artifacts under `.codex/ccg/`.
- `/ccg:context <subcommand>` - manage Codex-native context history under `.codex/ccg/context/`.
- `/ccg:commit` - prepare a safe commit message and gate checklist.
- `/ccg:rollback` - plan safe rollback or revert operations.
- `/ccg:clean-branches` - dry-run cleanup of safely merged branches.
- `/ccg:worktree <subcommand>` - manage Git worktrees with safety checks.
- `/ccg:spec-init` - initialize `.codex/ccg/specs/`.
- `/ccg:spec-research <requirement>` - write spec research and constraints.
- `/ccg:spec-plan <spec>` - create a Chinese spec-backed CCG plan.
- `/ccg:spec-impl <spec>` - execute a spec-backed plan.
- `/ccg:spec-review <spec>` - review spec, plan, implementation, and tests.
- `/ccg:team` - show Codex-native team workflow commands.
- `/ccg:team-research <task>` - research a task for worker ownership.
- `/ccg:team-plan <task>` - create a worker ownership plan.
- `/ccg:team-exec <plan>` - execute scoped worker plans with Codex as final owner.
- `/ccg:team-review <task>` - review worker output, diffs, and tests.
- `/ccg:review [plan-or-diff]` - review a CCG implementation.
- `/ccg:gemini-preview <prompt>` - manual smoke-test/debug entry for the same browser preview helper used automatically by CCG workflow Gemini calls.
- `/ccg:gptpro-plan <task>` - ordinary `/ccg:plan` semantics first, then manual GPT Pro planning evidence.
- `/ccg:gptpro-review [target]` - ordinary `/ccg:review` semantics first, then manual GPT Pro review evidence.
- `/ccg:gptpro-exc <task-or-plan>` - ordinary `/ccg:execute` preflight/routing evidence first, then manual GPT Pro second opinion before code landing.
- `/ccg:gen-docs <module-path>` - generate README/DESIGN skeletons for a new module.
- `/ccg:verify-change` - analyze change impact and documentation sync.
- `/ccg:verify-module <module-path>` - check module structure and required documentation.
- `/ccg:verify-quality <changed-path>` - inspect complexity, duplication, naming, and code smells.
- `/ccg:verify-security <changed-path>` - scan security-sensitive changes.

If the user provided a plan path or task, treat it as `/ccg:execute`.

Core rule: Codex plans and executes; Gemini and Claude assist as bounded read-only evidence helpers under the Codex-native parity rules from `fengshao1227/ccg-workflow`; Codex applies final edits, verifies, and reports in Chinese. M+ complexity and risky review paths use Gemini + Claude. Whenever any CCG workflow uses Gemini, it must invoke the bundled browser preview helper automatically rather than asking the user to run `/ccg:gemini-preview` manually. Whenever Claude evidence is required, use `~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper[.exe] --backend claude` and record whether the output was present.
