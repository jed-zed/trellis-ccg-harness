## Research

Use existing independent research agents with grok-search MCP. Search actively and
verify key conclusions against original sources; check versions/licenses when
reusing code and experiment conditions when adopting papers. Mark unverified findings.
Archived instructions below are inactive: ordinary work does not run Grok CLI/ACP,
wait for its gates, or require its manifests and hash packages.

<!-- Legacy Grok CLI/ACP reference; inactive in ordinary research.
## Automatic External Intelligence Gate

Before ordinary work, run the shared route once from the controller:

`ccg-codex route --workflow debug --phase intake --task-file ".ccg/tasks/<task-id>/intelligence-request.md" --state-file ".ccg/tasks/<task-id>/intelligence-route.json"`

Run this potentially long route with the host's tool-managed background execution and wait mechanism; never put it under a foreground timeout shorter than the runner's 10-minute timeout. If the host cancels or terminates the job before a terminal state is written, run `ccg-codex route recover --state-file <state-file> --status cancelled --reason "<reason>"` (or use `--status failed`); recovery refuses to overwrite a live owner.

Append existing --plan, --diff, --target, and repeatable --dependency paths whenever those artifacts are available. Add `--semantic-mode contract|incident --semantic-reason "<Codex judgment>"` only for an explicit semantic decision. The runtime honors disabled config, persists the decision reason, and must be re-run after plan, dependency, target, diff, or phase digest changes. Stop ordinary work on exit code `2`, `3`, or `4` only for an explicit required semantic route; advisory search failures do not block ordinary work.

Follow the shared **Companion Role Contract** when classifying the bug and
collecting hypotheses or second-pass review. Codex owns reproduction, fixes,
and verification.
